### ðŸ’¡ About me

My name is Steffen and I'm an electrical test engineer with a passion for software development. I've started programming more than 20 years ago and always tried new languages, concepts and libraries. Most of that time my code was private, for friends or tools that helped me at work. I made chatbots (early 2000s), video, audio and sharehoster sharing sites for my friends and many more tools. Also I like to tinker with microcontrollers and 3d printers. Recently I took a deep dive into machine learning and tried a few specific image classification and segmentation tasks.
